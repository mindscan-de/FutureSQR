		Okay long story short, the user either landed on this page either by choice, or because the
		user could not be authenticated transparently. Therefore we must aquire a token for sending
		the form to login.
		
		And then login using the AuthN Service. This can either have two outcomes, the user/password
		is wrong or not, if wrong, we must still remain on this page, but do we have to aquire a new
		token?
		
		If the user can be successfully authenticated, all kind of stuff must happen....
		
		* We must set the current user in the ui services. But this should be part of the success 
		  logic of the auth-n-service. 
		* Also the redirect after a successful login to the return url must be performed. can either 
		  be done here when the authn service has a success part and a fail part.
		* Some more clarifications needed here?
